<p>For Gold and Platinum service level customers, please contact us to make a plan for us to get and store your signpanels.  We recommend a minimum of six signpanels if your listings will be primarily in Northern VA.  If you plan to routinely have listings in MD/DC and VA, we recommend  a minimum of eight signpanels, so that we can store four signpanels in each in our warehouses in MD and VA.</p>
<p>And if you are ordering new signpanels, you can have them shipped directly to our VA warehouse at 10930 Clara Barton Drive, Fairfax Station VA 22039.</p>
<p><b><i>Unless we have your signpanels in our warehouse before you place the order, we can not guarantee that a signpanel will be installed with the signpost.</i></b></p>
<p>We also recommend that you keep at least one signpanel, so that you can put a panel at a listing in unique situations, like when a signpanel is vandalized by a disgruntled renter or neighbor.</p>
<p>Please keep this information safe for later use.</p>
<br />
Regards,<br />
Realty Sign Post<br />
