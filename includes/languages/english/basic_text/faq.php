When can I place my order? <a id=\"4\" name=\"4\"></a></span></strong><br /> <br /> 24 hours a day! However, To get your order scheduled for the next business day, it must be placed by 5PM. Orders placed after that time move to the day-after-tomorrow. That means that if an order is placed at 6PM on Tuesday, the first day that it can normally be installed is Thursday. NOTE: All Friday and weekend orders are done Monday or Tuesday.&nbsp; In order for us to provide you our best service, we ask that you schedule as many jobs as possible on Mondays through Wednesdays, since Thursday and Fridays are usually our busiest days. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. How long will the post remain at the listing? <a id=\"5\" name=\"5\"></a><br /> <br /> </span></strong>Current rental period is for four months.&nbsp; You may extend this time frame past four months by contacting Realty Sign Post at <a href=\"mailto:Info@realtysignpost.com\">Info@realtysignpost.com </a> and telling us how much longer than four months you will need the post.&nbsp; Realty Sign Post reserves the right to charge an \"Extended Post Rental Fee\" for installs left over four months.&nbsp; Realty Sign Post also reserves the right to remove a post, without notice, after the four month initial installation period if you have not contacted us requesting an extension. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. Can I get a &ldquo;RUSH&rdquo; on my SignPost Installation? <a id=\"6\" name=\"6\"></a></span></strong><br /> <br /> We do our best to meet your needs, with speedy signpost installations (90%+ jobs completed the next business day). However, if even faster service is absolutely necessary, it may be requested via an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:info@realtysignpost.com\">info@realtysignpost.com </a> or by calling 202 256 0107. If we are able to expedite the installation of your post, there will be a $35 additional fee. This $35 fee also applies to emergency Saturday installation orders. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. Can I keep the For Sale or Power Punch riders? <a id=\"7\" name=\"7\"></a></span></strong>Just like our posts, these riders are provided on a rental basis. If you keep the For Sale or Power Punch riders, you may be charged an additional fee for the lost/missing riders. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">SIGNPOST PLACEMENT and UNDERGROUND UTILITIES: <a id=\"SIGNPOSTPLACEMENT\" name=\"SIGNPOSTPLACEMENT\"></a></span></strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong><br /> <br /> Q. How do you decide where to place my sign? <a id=\"8\" name=\"8\"></a></strong></span><br /> <br /> We use several criteria: First, we don\'t want to damage any underground utilities, so we avoid any utility location indicators such as gas meters and transformers. Second, our installers are trained to place the post where it will get the best visibility with the optimal \"line of sight\" exposure. This means that the longer the passing public can see your sign, the higher the probability they will see it, remember it, and respond to it. Third, placement of posts can also be influenced by the desire to avoid trees, and/or not to disturb a yard or landscaped plants. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. I want my post installed in a specific location, how do I request an exact location?<a id=\"9\" name=\"9\"></a> </span></strong><br /> <br /> Please mark the location where you want to post with a flag, stick, rock or other very obvious object, and please tell us to install the post by that object in the &ldquo;Special Instructions&rdquo; section of the order placement process. We will gladly install the signpost where you or the homeowner want it to be placed, if you clearly mark the location before the installer arrives at the address.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><br /> <br /> Q. I don\'t like where the post is placed, can I have it moved? <a id=\"10\" name=\"10\"></a></span>We will install the signpost where you want it to be placed, if you clearly mark the location before the installer arrives at the address.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </strong>If you do not mark a location for the sign post installation, and ask for the post to be reinstalled at the same address, Realty Sign Post reserves the right to charge a \"Trip Charge\" or an additional \"Installation Charge\" <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><br /> <br /> Q. The homeowner has an underground sprinkler system and/or electric dog fence, what do I do?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"> <a id=\"11\" name=\"11\"></a></span></strong>Since there is no way for our signpost installers to determine where an underground sprinkler system or electric dog fence is located, the agent is required to specify an exact spot for the signpost to be located. Realty Sign Post accepts no responsibility for damage to underground facilities. Locating and marking such facilities are the responsibility of the homeowner and the agent. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /></a><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong>Q. There is a lamp in the yard, should I call Miss Utility before placing the signpost installation order?</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">&nbsp;<a id=\"12\" name=\"12\"></a></span></strong>We can contact Miss Utility for you. During the install order placement process, we ask if you want us to call Miss Utility. If you choose no, we then ask if there is a lamp in the yard, and if that lamp is a gas lamp. If there is a gas lamp, we will delay the install date by three business days, so that Miss Utility can mark the property.<br />You can also choose to have us call Miss Utility before the signpost is installed, whether there is a lamp in the yard or not. We recommend using the Miss Utility marking services if there are any yard lights (gas or electric) or any other visible electrical or telephone boxes (light green in color) in the yard.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><br /> <br /> SIGN PANEL QUESTIONS: <a id=\"SIGNPANEL\" name=\"SIGNPANEL\"></a></span></strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong><br /> <br /> Q. I am a new agent, can you make sign panels for me? <a id=\"13\" name=\"13\"></a></strong></span><br /> <br /> Sorry, but we don\'t make signpanels, we quickly and professionally install signposts. However, there are many local and national companies that make signpanels. Below is the contact information for four of these companies. Lowen Sign, <a href=\"http://www.lowensign.com/\">www.lowensign.com </a>, 1-800-545-5505 Aztec Marking Co, <a href=\"http://www.aztecsigns.com/\">www.aztecsigns.com </a>, 1-800-835-2548, Fax: 1-800-321-7265 Dee Signs, <a href=\"http://www.deesigncompany.com/\">www.deesigncompany.com </a>, 1-800-DEE-SIGN Oakley Signs, <a href=\"http://verasend.com/r.html?c=298897&amp;r=298344&amp;t=321353299&amp;l=1&amp;d=85147775&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eoakleysign%2ecom&amp;g=0&amp;f=-1\">http://www.oakleysign.com </a>, 1-800-373-5330 <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. What size sign panels should I order? <a id=\"14\" name=\"14\"></a><br /> <br /> </span></strong>The following guidelines are provided so that you can get the right signs when you order from your sign provider. Panel size not wider than 30\" and 18\"-24\" deep. Top hole spacing of 17-19\" apart. Inside diameter of top holes about 1/2\" and about 3/8\" from top edge of panel. We recommend all holes in the top and bottom of your signs have grommets (brass liners that make holes stronger).&nbsp; The grommets nearly double the life of your signs because they protect the integrity of the sign surface from moisture penetration and do not tear out easily. Inside diameter of bottom holes not less than 5/16\".&nbsp; Same spacing as your riders. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. How can I get my sign panels to you to store? <a id=\"15\" name=\"15\"></a></span></strong><br /> <br /> You have several options: 1. You can have them shipped to us at: Realty Sign Post <br /> C/O Mini U Stor <br /> Attention: RyanW. Myers or H. Douglas Myers <br /> 10930 Clara Barton Dr. <br /> Fairfax Station, VA. 22039-1412 Please make sure you have carefully reviewed and approved the proof, since Realty SignPost assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the sign order. 2. We can pick your panels up from your agency office or a listing. Please e-mail us at info@ realtysignpost.com to make arrangements for pick up. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. How many signpanels should I store with you? <a id=\"16\" name=\"16\"></a><br /> <br /> </span></strong>We recommend at least two panels per county that you expect listings in, and a minimum of six signpanels. If you are a big listing agent, you will obviously need more panels. We have several warehouses in the Washington DC area, and we place your panels in the appropriate warehouse in order to provide you fast service. We can not guarantee a signpanel will be installed at a property on the same day that the panel is removed from a different property. This is due to the fact that Realty SignPost has multiple installers working multiple installation areas, and the same installer may not complete both the install and removal. Please allow at least two business days to complete a removal and two business days to complete the install. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. Should I keep one or two of my signpanels? <a id=\"17\" name=\"17\"></a></span></strong><br /> <br /> Yes, we recommend agents keep a few of their signpanels for the unique situations that occur from time to time. For example, you may get a condo listing, or we may be able to complete a RUSH signpost installation, but not be able to get the signpanel installed in a RUSH manner. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top </a></p>

How do I pay? <a id=\"18\" name=\"18\"></a></strong></span><br /> <br /> Most of our customers pay via our online credit card processing system. The one time charge at the time of the install includes the signpost install, the signpost rental for up to 8 months, and the removal of the signpost. For some agencies, we have a monthly invoicing agreement. If you belong to one of those agencies, you can choose to pay via credit card, or have the signpost rental charged to your agency\'s invoice. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<p><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. What additional fees do you charge? <a id=\"19\" name=\"19\"></a><br /> <br /> </span></strong>We strive to provide fast, dependable and professional service. In order to continue to provide this level of quality service, and to encourage agents to provide the information we need to deliver quality service, we charge the following fees in the following situations. Summary List of Additional Charges: Lost/Damaged Post: $60 Declined Credit Card Fee $25 Lost/Damaged metal anchor: $20 Trip Charge: $20 Missing Incorrect Map Coordinates: $15 Incorrect Address Information: $10 Fax/Voice Mail Order Processing: $10 Missing Riders at Removal: $10 per rider Missing Hooks/Clips at Removal $10 Missing Brochure Box at Removal $10 Installer Travel Allowance Varies by Location Late Payment Fee $10 <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a> <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">WEBSITE QUESTIONS: </span></strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong><br /> <br /> Q.

Your name and information is stored in what are called &lsquo;cookies\' on your specific computer. If your information disappears, it is due to one of three reasons. 1. The &lsquo;cookies\' on your computer have been cleared. 2. You are at a new computer that you haven\'t placed an order yet. 3. Your computer is configured to not allow the website to store &lsquo;cookies\'. For the first two reasons, simply enter your information, and it will be stored for the next time you place an order. For the third reason, talk to your IT person and have them configure your computer to allow cookies from Realtysignpost.com <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top </a> <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><br /> Q. I can\'t change the county in your website drop down list, what do I do? <a id=\"21\" name=\"21\"></a><br /> <br /> </span></strong>Our website works best with the latest versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer, V6.0 as of Nov 05 and Mozilla Firefox, V1.0.7. If you don\'t have the latest versions, the Java enabled dropdown lists may not work correctly. We recommend you download and install the free upgrade for your web browsers.

Please consult with your IT person if you are uncomfortable upgrading software on your own. Upgrading your browser provides many other benefits, including updated features and the latest security against hackers and viruses. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a> <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. I can\'t place an order via your website, can I fax or phone in the order? <a id=\"22\" name=\"22\"></a></span></strong><br /> <br /> Yes, orders can be faxed to 703 995 4567 or 202 478 2131. Voicemail orders may also be left at the numbers by calling those numbers and pressing &lsquo;1\' to leave a recording. We prefer and encourage website orders, since it offers many advantages over fax and phone orders. These include an e-mail verifying placement of your order and easier removal of the post (if cookies are enabled on your computer). <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a><br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong>Q. I can\'t find ADC map coordinates, and your website requires them, what do I do? <a id=\"23\" name=\"23\"></a><br /> </strong></span></p>
<p>ADC mapbooks are one of the standard map books for the Washington DC area, and are usually included in MRIS listings. These books are available at any 7-11 store , most convenience stores, Realtor stores, and many other stores. The books can also be ordered via <a href=\"http://www.adcmap.com/\">www.adcmap.com </a>. If you don\'t have quick access to an ADC map book, you can look at old MRIS listings for this property, or other properties on the same street or in the same development to see if the listing realtor included ADC map coordinates. Even if the property is new construction, it will still have ADC map grid coordinates. Simply look up the coordinates of the closest major road/intersection. For new construction, accurate directions and map coordinates are even more important to enable to locate the property in a timely manner. ADC or Thomas Brother map coordinates are required. If you just have Thomas Brother map coordinates, you may enter 1-A-1 for the ADC map coordinates, and the order will go through. Entering incorrect map coordinates or not providing map coordinates invalidates our &ldquo;Two Business Day&rdquo; installation policy and may result in a $15 charge to look up map coordinates. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a><a href=\"#top\"> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q. Why do you need map coordinates? <a id=\"24\" name=\"24\"></a></span></strong><br /> <br /> In order to continue provide FAST and DEPENDABLE signpost installation service, we need to be able to find each and every property quickly. Our experience is that if we have an accurate house number and street, good directions and map coordinates allows your job to be assigned to the correct installer and allows the installer to be able to use mapping software, the Internet and maps to locate the property in a timely fashion. If any of that information is missing, it often takes disproportionately longer to find the correct house. So far, our worst example is an agent who ordered an installation for a house in Mclean, but the house was actually in Manassas . Obviously, this created a great delay for all the other jobs that installer had to complete that day. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a><a href=\"#top\"> <br /> </a><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong>MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS: <a id=\"MISCELLANEOUSQUESTIONS\" name=\"MISCELLANEOUSQUESTIONS\"></a></strong><strong><br /> <br /> Q. My homeowner wants a mailbox installed, will you provide this service. <a id=\"25\" name=\"25\"></a></strong></span><br /> <br /> Yes and No! J Most of my installers are happy to install a mailbox, but they are responsible to working out the details with the homeowner. It will not be a business transaction associated with Realty SignPost. Just e-mail us the address and phone number of the person to contact and an installer will contact the person, and work out a price. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top<br /> <br /> </a> <strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Q.

<p>No. We have provided this service in the past, and found that it is best for the agent to install directionals. This is due to the fact that directionals often quickly disappear, and we don\'t always go to a property via the same streets that the agent would like the directionals posted. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a></p>
