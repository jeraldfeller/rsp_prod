				<p><font size=\"+0\">This new site has many of the features that you, our customers, have requested in the past.</font></p>

				<h2>HOW TO START USING THE NEW SITE:</h2>

				<p><font size=\"+0\">If you have placed an order with us in the past, you can click <a href=\"forgotten_password.php\">HERE</a> and then enter your e-mail address and a new password will be sent to you.  If you need to be reminded of what e-mail address is on file with us, just call us at 202-256-0107.</font></p>

				<p><font size=\"+0\">You can also click "Forgotten Your Password" (on side bar under the login boxes) at anytime to have a new password sent to you.</font></p>

				<p><font size=\"+0\">Once you have your password, you can login and see a list of existing installed signposts, check status of existing orders, make changes to orders you recently placed, change and update signpost removal dates and many other features.  For example, in the near future, you will be able to see how many of your signpanels and riders you have installed at listings and how many Realty SignPost has stored for you in our warehouses.</font></p>

				<p><font size=\"+0\">If you are a credit card customer, you can pay for your order at the time you place it and no longer need to send in a credit card authorization form.</font></p>

				<p><font size=\"+0\">You can still use our old website by clicking <a href=\"http://www.realtysignpost.com/index.php4\">here</a>, but please know that we plan to close down this site by May 2009.</font></p>
