<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><font size=\"+1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the agent requests and marks a specific location, Realty SignPost will install the post where requested to do so, if possible. Underground utilities and legal guidelines (which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction) may affect signpost placement. (Please see the following link for guidance on legal restrictions on signpost placement: <a href=\"http://www.nvar.com/newsdetail.lasso?articleno=nvarn100456\">http://www.nvar.com/newsdetail.lasso?articleno=nvarn100456</a>)</font></div>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font size=\"+1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If agent does not mark a specific location for the sign post installation, Realty SignPost will place the signpost for best visibility, in the judgment of the Realty SignPost installer. If agent does not mark a specific location for the sign post installation, and later asks for the post to be reinstalled at the same address, Realty Sign Post reserves the right to charge a trip charge or an additional \"Installation Charge\"</font></p>
<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top </a></p>
<p><font size=\"+1\"> ORDER PLACEMENT:<a id=\"orderplacement\" name=\"orderplacement\"></a>&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agent is responsible for providing complete and accurate property address information. This includes house number, correctly spelled street name, city, zip code, county, directions and accurate ADC or Thomas Brother&rsquo;s Map coordinates. All of this information must be provided correctly or the order completion policy is invalidated and additional charges may apply.<br /> Agent is responsible for knowing, prior to placing order, if posts are permissible at installation address. If a Realty SignPost installer is turned away by the homeowner or the Home Owner Association, a trip charge will apply.<br /> For signpost installations on vacant land and construction sites must have locator stakes in place by agent prior to placing the installation order.<br /> Realty SignPost prefers orders to be placed via its website, www.realtysignpost.com. Orders placed via fax must be clearly legible. Orders placed via voicemail must be clearly understandable. Realty SignPost reserves the right to charge an additional fee for processing fax or voice mail orders.<br /> <span class=\"footernote\"><br /> <br /> </span></font><span class=\"footernote\"><a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a></span><font size=\"+1\"><span class=\"footernote\"> <br /> <br /> UTILITY LINES AND OTHER UNDERGROUND LINES:</span><a id=\"utlitylines\" name=\"utlitylines\"></a><span class=\"footernote\"><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By placing an order with Realty Signpost, whether via Internet, phone or fax, agent accepts full responsibility for locating, identifying and marking all underground equipment, including utility lines, cable lines, sprinkler systems and underground dog fences. Neither Realty Sign Post LLC nor its subcontractors accepts responsibility for damage to unmarked underground facilities. Locating and marking such facilities are the responsibility of the homeowner and the agent. <br /> The presence of yard lights (gas or electric) or any visible electrical or telephone boxes (light green in color) indicates that there are underground utility lines at the property. In these situations, Realty SignPost recommends that the homeowner or agent call Miss Utility, 1-800-552-7001, http://www.missutilityofvirginia.com/ to have the locations of the underground utilities marked, prior to ordering the signpost installation. Allow two business days for Miss Utility to mark the appropriate lines.</span><br /> </font><a href=\"#top\"><br /> ^ Back to Top </a><font size=\"+1\"><br /> <br /> ORDER CHANGES/CANCELLATIONS:<a id=\"orderchanges\" name=\"orderchanges\"></a><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For changes to your order before 5PM the day before your order is to be completed, please e-mail the change to INFO@REALTYSIGNPOST.COM. <br /> For cancellations after 5PM the day before your order is scheduled to be completed, please call 202 256 0107 to cancel the order. A Trip Charge may apply depending on the timing of the order cancellation.<br /> <br /> </font><a href=\"#top\">^ Back to Top</a><font size=\"+1\"> <br /> <br /> SIGN PANEL INSTALLATION POLICY:&nbsp; <a id=\"signpanel\" name=\"signpanel\"></a><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realty SignPost also provides sign panel storage and installation service to agents who request and sign up for this service. Agent must have provided sufficient panels to Realty SignPost, and a panel must be in the appropriate Realty SignPost warehouse at the time installation order is scheduled to be completed. Realty SignPost does NOT guarantee that a sign panel will be installed at a property on the same day that the panel is removed from a different property. This is due to the fact that Realty SignPost has multiple installers working multiple installation areas, and the same installer may not complete both the install and removal.<br /> If an agent has not placed an order with Realty SignPost for one year, their panels may be disposed of by Realty SignPost without notice. If an agent wants their panels returned, agent is responsible for the pickup of their sign panels at the appropriate Realty SignPost warehouse.<br /> &nbsp;</font><font size=\"+1\"> &nbsp; <br /> </font><a href=\"#top\"><br /> ^ Back to Top</a><font size=\"+1\"> <br /> <br /> SIGNPOST RENTAL PERIOD AND REMOVAL:<a id=\"signpostrental\" name=\"signpostrental\"></a><span class=\"footernote\"><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realty SignPost services are a rental relationship with the agent and/or agency. Agent is fully responsible for the prompt return of all items rented from Realty SignPost, including posts, riders, brochure boxes and attaching hooks/clips.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signpost rental period is the lesser of 120 days from date of installation, or 7 days from the date the property sale closes or the listing is withdrawn from the agent or the market.&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realty Sign Post reserves the right to remove a post, without notice, after the four month initial installation period if the post has no panel or the agent has not requested an extended rental.&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agents may request an additional 120 day rental period by contacting Realty SignPost via e-mail, INFO@REALTYSIGNPOST.COM.&nbsp; There is no charge for extending the rental period up to 240 days.&nbsp; After 240 days, $20 will be charged to extend the rental period for each additional 120 days.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agents and homeowners are strictly forbidden from moving or removing installed posts.&nbsp; If post or metal PVC post anchor is damaged in any way, agent/agency is responsible for up to a $60 lost/damaged post charge.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When ordering a removal, agent is responsible for post being accessible for pickup by insuring the post is not locked in a garage, storage shed, etc. &nbsp;If post is not recovered on first trip, a $20 trip charge may be charged for each additional trip.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If post is not ordered down immediately after property closing, and/or post is not returned to Realty SignPost, agent/agency is responsible for a $60 lost/damaged post charge.</span></font><br /> <a href=\"#top\"><br /> ^ Back to Top </a><br /> <br /> <font size=\"+1\">AGENT INFORMATION: <a id=\"agentinformation\" name=\"agentinformation\"></a><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agent is responsible for providing accurate information in the &ldquo;New Account Set Up Form&rdquo;.
